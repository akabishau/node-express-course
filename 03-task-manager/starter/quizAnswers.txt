1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
- Middleware functions can be used for different tasks like logging, authentication, etc.
- Using these custom functions, we can define and control the flow of the app logic.
- Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, and they also have "next" function which is used to go to the next middleware function in the app flow
- The order of calling middleware functions in the app.js matters.
- Middleware functions can be applied for all or specific routes if defined
